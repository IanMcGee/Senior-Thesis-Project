 ## VR Training Game

 ### Description
 
 ####   For the purposes of this class, I wish to create a shooting gallery course in VR. Players will be able to move around a virtual map and aim and shoot at targets that pop up as the course is traversed. The course time and accuracy will not only appear on screen but also used to rate the player on thier performance. My hope is to create a semi-realistic target practice game. I originally got the idea to make this hyper-realistic, down to a controller that kicked to mimic the actual use of a firearm, however; that would be too complicated for the purposes of this project so hopefully I will be able to continue this after graduation.
